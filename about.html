                            I was born on 21 December 1999 in Kursela, Katihar, Bihar to Deepak Deep, a Jaiswal hindu Father and Saroj Devi ,a beutiful Hindu Mother.
                            I began to seek intrest in Computers in my early age of 8. I even satrted to keep a diary
                            of my own to keep all my computer discoveries.<br>
                            Later in 2009, My father bought the broadband connection for ME,I was super Happy.That was the point i completely turned myself to web.

                        <p>
                            My primary Education took place in my village Kursela. Later, I kept changing school from time to time, only in search for the best.<br>
                            My first school was Siksha Bharti. As much i can recall i stayed there for one year then moved to NBS(New Brilliant School) that was the
                            longest i stayed in same school. Then in 2010, I moved to Gogri Jamalpur, Bihar(My Gradma's Place) and studied in BSRPS (Brilliant Star Residential
                            Public School) just for a year. intresting fact! Actually we (std. 5 and 6 );i was in 6th; had our class together.<br>
                            My new chapter started when i moved to a boarding school DPS(Delhi Public School) in Bhagalpur, Bihar back in 2012. This was one of my premium
                            phase of my life and pocket loosening phase for my family. I studied for 4 years and i'm sure that it must have cost my father more than 10 Lakhs.
                            But my father saw this as investment and kept enjoying my life and studying and left that school in 2016 with flying colors.(10 CGPA to be exact:) )  
                            <br>
                            Later i continued my high school in DAV Public School Danapur cantt from JUNE 2018.This phase was the most troubling one. Daily school, to keep my boards percentage high; 
                            then Coaching to crack the Engineering Entrance exam left me all tired. But in the end, My hard work brought colors (but not so bright :( )
                            and i got a college, MNIT to be exact. And i'm happy a learner ever since.
                            And I scored 94.4% in 12th.(Yeah, I was the topper of my School)
